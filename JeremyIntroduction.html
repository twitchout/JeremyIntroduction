        <h1>My name is Jeremy Kirkpatrick</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
            <p>My favorite foreign culture is Welsh. <br>
            They are relatively close to where my ancestor descended from. <br>
            A lot of bedtime stories I was read as a kid were based off Kings of old time Wales.
            </p>
        <br>
        <br>
            <p>Two historical figures who inspire me are Epictetus, and Zeno </p>
        <br>
        <br>
            <p>A meal that represents me best is Pizza. <br>
            I can eat this on any occasion or on the go.  </p>
        <br>
        <br>
            <p>I feel most creative when I am free of external distractions. <br>
            Half an hour of silence is key to restoring mental and social exhaustion</p>
